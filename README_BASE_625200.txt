Methodocracy

"The Super-Power of Problem-Solving"


A free website that facilitates problem-solving. Kind of like Wikipedia, but instead of logging already known information, it focuses on accumulating new knowledge using established methods, especially the scientific method. Credentialed users and average Joe's can use the site alike.


We need to work together to make unlikely connections, to think more creatively as a whole than we would have alone.

Users browse, search, and submit entries into the knowledge base. Entries can disprove, support, replicate, or peer-review other entries. The website calculates and informs users the status of an entry's validity using this system. An entry is most meritable if it follows the scientific method correctly. An entry is least meritable if it is just an opinion, or comment, and is less visible when sorting. Lower merit entries should not be dismissed, however, because they often inspire more meritable entries to be submitted.


Mission Statement

To engage everyone in problem-solving, using the scientific method as the most meritable method. To ensure that, through Methodocracy, humanity always has the ability to problem solve as much and as fast as possible.


Vision Statement

To be known as the first place where thinkers and problem-solvers go. To ensure the survival of humanity, life, and consciousness. To take care of suffering and improve the quality of life for everyone now and in the future.


There is something missing on the Internet, its true potential has yet to be unlocked.
