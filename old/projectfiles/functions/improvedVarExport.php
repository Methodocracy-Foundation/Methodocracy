*     will return the variable representation instead of outputting it.
* @return mixed|null Returns the variable representation when the

*     function will return NULL.

 Example usage:

$obj->test = 'abc';
$obj->other = 6.2;
$obj->arr = array (1, 2, 3);

improved_var_export((object) array (
    'prop1' => true,

 Output:
