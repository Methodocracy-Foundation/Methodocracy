"The Super-Power of Problem-Solving"


We're setting up a free website that facilitates the act of problem-solving, where evidence-based arguments hold more weight than arguments like opinions.



Benefits

    Attempts to solve the world's biggest problems, as well as smaller problems
    Supports governmental and non-governmental decision making
    Applies metrics and program evaluation to complex social systems




If you want to advocate for a certain position, such as addressing poverty, you would state your arguments on the site. If you back up your arguments with rigorous scientific research, then your arguments get weighted more heavily. If you just state an opinion with no research or any facts at all, then that gets weighted the least, and is put further down in a hierarchy of arguments for and against that particular topic.

However, no one should entirely dismiss an opinion, as it may contain truths that have yet to be validated by research. After all, Einstein's theory of relativity started out as just a thought, with no research to back it up.

Anyone can propose arguments on any subject, and ideally, this site could be useful when determining the best course of action in setting policy within governmental entities, political initiatives, scientific endeavors, nonprofit initiatives, corporate actions -- well, just about anything! Perhaps it could also centralize scientific publication.


There is something missing on the Internet, its true potential has yet to be unlocked.
