Methodocracy Foundation

What do we want? Evidence-based change! When do we want it? After peer review and replication!

There is something missing on the Internet, its true potential has yet to be unlocked.

Summary:

Methodocracy.org is a website that ensures that the human race doesn't die off. Using the scientific method and other proven methods, it helps people to reason and it helps people to work with others collaboratively in their reasoning. Methodocracy will use it's solutions to inroduce laws and policies in our society.

The website is structured in a way that incentivizes using the scientific method and other proven methods to problem-solve. Posts are categorized into all of the possible parts that make up different methods. The methods include things like: a citation for a source that brings evidence to the discussion, an essay that explains a thought process for a multitude of citations, a study/experiment performed by credentialed users or as citizen science, or parts of any of those.

The posts are connected in many different ways that convey deep meaning, building a robust knowledge base for problem-solving. This makes it possible for more meaningful information to be searched, which allows insights to be made that were previously unreachable. These insights can be connected to other areas that can benefit from them. This, in turn, drives more inspired discussions, debate, and collaboration. Additionally, non-malicious bots can be used to take care of the menial problem-solving tasks en masse, such as drawing connections between related posts. More advanced artificial intelligence can provide deep analysis and insights for us to use. Some examples of connections are ones that disprove, support, replicate, peer-review, allude to, expand upon, break down, summarize, etc. other posts.

The website calculates and informs users the status of an entry's strength using this system. An entry is most meritable if it follows rigorous scientific, logical, and ethical methods. An entry is least meritable if it is just an opinion or comment, and is less visible when sorting. Lower merit entries should not be dismissed, however, because they often inspire more meritable entries to be submitted.

Using these systems, we can tackle problem-solving ventures that have been previously impractical to undertake. We can solve the problems we know we need to solve, but for some reason we are not solving.

The current scientific community is broken. According to the article, “The 7 biggest problems science faces, according to scientists" (http://www.clearerthinking.org/single-post/2016/08/30/The-7-biggest-problems-science-faces-according-to-scientists) these are the issues the scientific community faces:

1. Academia has a huge money problem
Funding is difficult to receive, scientists start to rely on third party grants. This introduces problematic incentives for scientists.

2. Too many studies are poorly designed
There is pressure to make findings look more profound by verifying their hypothesis. Scientists use misleading tactics.

3. Scientists rarely replicate experimental results
There is little incentive to replicate a study, producing new results is valued more.

4. Peer review doesn't work the way it's supposed to
There is little incentive to carefully and properly peer review.

5. Scientific journal paywalls make reading results expensive
Many publications are for-profit and but everything behind expensive subscription paywalls.

6. Science is often poorly communicated to the public
Sensationalism is rampant with journalists and university PR departments, with scientists having little reason to correct the issue.

7. It's very hard to be a young scientist
Long hours, low pay, short contracts incentivize conservative work, severe employer’s market, depression rampant.


Methodocracy.org will:

1. Remove confirmation bias that is caused by being motivated to make headlines.

2. Ensure that experiments are designed, analyzed, and reported rigorously.

3. Ensure that experiments are replicated before being taken seriously.

4. Incentivize careful and proper peer review.

5. Make everything available for free.

6. Not tolerate sensationalism when reporting findings.


The core target audience will be fringe political groups that want to prove their ideals.

The goal of everything on Methodocracy is to make a change in the world. So after much deliberation on the website, people will start focusing on how to implement their ideas into our society. The website will host bill drafting for the public sector and proposals for the private sector to implement any solutions that have converged using the scientific method to better problems in the world.


Mission Statement

To engage everyone in problem-solving using the scientific method and other proven methods. To ensure that, through Methodocracy, humanity always has the ability to problem solve as much and as fast as possible.


Vision Statement

To be known as the first place where thinkers and problem-solvers go. To ensure the survival of all. To improve the quality of life for all now and in the future.


GitHub is chosen for the website's code. It is a site that manages files, keep all overwritten versions of them and allowing multiple branches of the work to be held. GitHub is chosen to allow the world to have access the the files. The world can even contribute code if I accept it.
