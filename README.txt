Methodocracy Foundation

What do we want? Evidence-based change! When do we want it? After peer review and replication!


I'm making a website called Methodocracy. I value helping people to reason, and I value helping them to work with others in their reasoning. Wikipedia only logs what we already know, I want to start logging our thought processes for what we don't know yet. Well then why don't we just use forums or Reddit? I'll tell you why. It's because are you really satisfied with the quality of most posts? Let us use the scientific method and other proven methods to solve the world's problems!

The website is structured in a way that incentivizes using the scientific method and other proven methods to problem-solve.

Users browse, search, and submit entries into the knowledge base. Entries can disprove, support, replicate, peer-review, allude to, expand upon, break down, summarize, etc. other entries. The website calculates and informs users the status of an entry's strength using this system. An entry is most meritable if it follows rigorous scientific, philosophical, and ethical methods. An entry is least meritable if it is just an opinion or comment, and is less visible when sorting. Lower merit entries should not be dismissed, however, because they often inspire more meritable entries to be submitted.

The core target audience is attendees of academic conferences.

The current academic community is broken. methodocracy.org will:
1.	Remove confirmation bias that is caused by being motivated to make headlines.
2.	Ensure that experiments are designed, analyzed, and reported rigorously.
3.	Ensure that experiments are replicated before being taken seriously.
4.	Incentivize careful and proper peer review.
5.	Make everything available for free.
6.	Not tolerate sensationalism when reporting findings.
In addition, methodocracy.org does more than publish science. It hosts a web of debate surrounding that science and involves the general population to take part in the debate as well as take part in citizen science. The website will host bill drafting for the public sector and proposals for the private sector to implement any solutions that have converged using the scientific method to better problems in the world.

Example:
A research organization uses Methodocracy to upload their old experiments and create new entries for new experiments and the debate surrounding all of it. When a discovery is made that something is causing harm in society, the organization---in collaboration with other organizations and the general public---get to work. They must be skeptical, not sensationalize their findings, find the complexities that are relatively closer to the truth than the initial black and white, and evaluate several possible action plans to remedy the problem. When ready, the project is presented to those who write laws and those who set company policies.


Mission Statement

To engage everyone in problem-solving, using the scientific method, ethics, and practical philosophy as the most meritable methods. To educate users on solutions by having the entire process transparent. To ensure that, through Methodocracy, humanity always has the ability to problem solve as much and as fast as possible.


Vision Statement

To be known as the first place where thinkers and problem-solvers go. To ensure the survival of all. To take care of suffering and improve the quality of life for all now and in the future.


There is something missing on the Internet, its true potential has yet to be unlocked.
