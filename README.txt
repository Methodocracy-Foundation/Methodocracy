Methodocracy:

A cultural-political ideology which proposes that optimal decision-making, from the individual to national level, is necessarily based upon the quantity and quality of data, interpretation, and conclusions gathered through tested and reliable methodologies.


Hurdles: 

1. It is prohibitively expensive and time-consuming for the average citizen to access information due to the high cost of scientic journals/articles and the lack of a centralized database.

2. Even with free and convenient access to a centralized information archive, the vast majority of the population have little training nor ability to determine the quality of data, interpretations, conclusions, and methodologies. This results in confusion and distrust for information-based-decision-making, since bad information contradicts good information and the two are indistinguishable to the untrained mind.


Proposal:

To create and develop a free, user-friendly, crowdsourced website that archives and rates research projects in order to facilitate problem-solving and decision-making. A chimera of wikipedia, researchgate, and reddit, it would allow users to submit questions/problems, reply with hypotheses or entire researh projects, and rate others' submissions on scientific coherence and readability. It will focus on teaching and guiding its user on data collection, analysis, and interpretation, while acting as a database for all user-submitted queries and researches. Additionally, it would serve as a scientific-networking platform for both small and large scale collaborations. All users will be able to rate all submissions, however the impact of a user's rating will be based upon the quality/quantity of their contributions, their work/education background, and other relevant factors.


Goals:

    To centralize scientific publications.
    To teach, enable, and engage the entire population in problem solving through the scientific method.
    To robustly organize and rank information.
    To be crowdsourced, free, and free from special interests.
    To be easy to cite/reference/exchange information
    Can be used to solve problems that are economic, corporate, social, governmental, environmental, existential threats, etc.
    Can be used to solve problems such as how to run methodocracy and how it should be designed.
    Can be used to determine the best recipe of apple pie.


Users browse, search, and submit entries into the knowledge base. Entries can disprove, support, replicate, or peer-review other entries. The website calculates and informs users the status of an entry's validity using this system. An entry is most meritable if it follows the scientific method correctly. An entry is least meritable if it is just an opinion, or comment, and is less visible when sorting. Lower merit entries should not be dismissed, however, because they often inspire more meritable entries to be submitted.


Mission Statement:

To teach and engage 7+ billion people in investigative science and critical thinking. To maximize collaboration and assist humanity in reaching its collective intellectual potential.


Vision Statement:

To be known as the first place where thinkers and problem-solvers go. To ensure the survival of humanity, life, and consciousness. To alleviate suffering and improve the quality of life for sentient beings now and in the future.


The internet promised humanity the tree of knowledge and the garden of eden, but it has yet delivered. Its true potential remains dormant, to be realized. We must work together to collect more data, to think more creatively, to inspire each other, and to realize that working together toward prosperity for all is more rewarding and effective than killing each other for non-renewable resources.
